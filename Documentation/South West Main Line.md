# South West Main Line

The South West Main Line runs from London Waterloo to Weymouth on the south coast, via Woking, Basingstoke, Winchester, Southampton, Bournemouth, Poole and Dorchester. The line is 3rd rail electrified in its entirety. From London to Basingstoke the line is four tracks, then the remainder is two tracks with the exception of a short length of four tracks in Southampton, and single track near Dorchester.

This simulation covers the section of the South West Main Line from Southampton Central to Dorchester South. Services are predominantly operated by South Western Railway using Class 444 and 450 units on the main line, with Class 158 units operating the Salisbury to Romsey "Rounder" service. Great Western Railway services also use Class 158 units, along with Class 165 and 166, on their Portsmouth Harbour to Cardiff Central service via Southampton Central. CrossCountry operates a service to Bournemouth using Class 220 and 221 "Voyager" trains, and Southern operate several services terminating at Southampton Central using Class 377 units.

## Simulation

The timetable included represents a Wednesday in March 2023, running from 04:20 until about 03:30 then next morning, with the following standard off peak services:

- 1tph London Waterloo to Weymouth (SWR)
- 1tph London Waterloo to Weymouth & Poole, splitting at Bournemouth (SWR)
- 1tph Winchester to Bournemouth (SWR)
- 1tph Salisbury to Romsey (SWR)
- 2tph Brockenhurst to Lymington Pier (SWR)
- 1tph Southampton Central to Portsmouth & Southsea (SWR)
- 1tph Southampton Central to Brighton (SN)
- 1tph Southampton Central to London Victoria (SN)
- 1tph Portsmouth Harbour to Cardiff Central (GWR)
- 1tp2h Bournemouth to Manchester Piccadilly (XC)

In peak hours additional services operate, and some services split/join at Southampton Central instead of Bournemouth. There are also plenty of freight services in and out of the ports at Southampton throughout the day.

## Operational Tips

- Keep an eye on the platform allocations given in the description of each train for Southampton Central and Bournemouth - if you stick to these everything should work.
- Double check the instructions for trains terminating at Poole - some can arrive on the normal platform and enter the sidings/loops, while others need to arrive on the northbound platform.
- Its a good idea to set points for the route you want before actually setting the route - this is due to the amount of bi-directional track, and helps avoid blocking up the throats to the larger stations by mistake.
- Keep an eye on passing times for freight services - they tend to run early so it might be necessary to find somewhere to hold them for a bit (Southampton's Down Goods Loop is helpful for this!)
- Some trains may be held at red signals behind slower services - provided they've been routed in the correct order this shouldn't impact their schedule.
- The line operates as four tracks in the Millbrook area, with the fast lines on the outside and slow lines on the inside. In general only trains stopping at Millbrook use the slow lines, but it may sometimes be necessary to route other trains along them as well.
- Typically, it is best to keep freight on the bottom track in the Southampton area (past Millbrook) unless multiple freight trains need to pass each other. This keeps it out the way of passenger services.
